# # Badges.
# #Â Since different terminal render symbols and emoji in an inconsistent way
# # with respect to spacing, we allow to tweak the "width" in terms of number
#Â #Â of characters per each badge.

# #Â For example the ðŸ—¡ symbol should technically render in one character
# # space, but depending on the font use it might overflow to the next
# # character.

# #Â Light background for dark nicknames.
#Â #Â If the colour of a nickname is too dark we set a lighter background to
# # make it more visible. Set the brightness threshold below which the lighter
#Â #Â background is enabled. The range is 0 to 255.

# # Messages are stored in a ring buffer of constant length. Increase if you
